## Summary

- Added configurable pre-prayer notifications with a default 20-minute alert (configurable via `prayerReminder.alertMinutes`).
- Improved release automation with a GitHub Actions workflow that packages and publishes the VSIX on merges to `main` or manual dispatch.

## Installation

### Using VS Code UI

- Download the attached `prayer-reminder-1.0.5.vsix` file from the release assets.

- Run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** and select the downloaded package.

### Using the CLI
